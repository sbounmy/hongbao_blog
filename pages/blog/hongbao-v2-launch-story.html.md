June 14th. Our 24kg package gets stuck in French customs. 5,000+ envelopes. $250 in express shipping. Gone.

They think it's drugs. Or counterfeit. Or illegal. They won't tell us exactly.

It's paper envelopes with "Bitcoin" written on them. That's it.

## The damage

- Lost 5,000 envelopes
- $250 shipping (non-refundable)
- Insurance paid out $350 (barely covered shipping)
- Had to cancel and refund orders
- Pissed off customers

## Meanwhile, this tweet hits hard

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are many ways to do this already in existence, but red envelopes do look nice and has some background to it iirc - wish they had used that logo they have on geyser vs the MJB logo on the envelopes though.</p>&mdash; MoparMiningLLC (@MoparMining) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoparMining/status/1937178693878927454?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

He's right. Our design needed work.

## So we redesigned everything

Spent 2 weeks with designer Salma and my uncle (15 years printing experience):

![New Hong₿ao v2.0 designs - Orange envelopes](/assets/blog/hongbao-v2-launch-story/new-designs-orange.png)

- Bought `hbtc.me` domain (shorter = cleaner QR codes)
- Envelope back has a QR code which goes to a getting started step by step for newcoiner
- The red envelope totally assume the chinese tradition while the orange one is more neutral to Bitcoin
- Added ₿ symbol on the flap
- Cleaner back design


## New shipping strategy

Screw customs. We're shipping directly from Shenzhen with our partner Linda.

- No more customs BS
- Cheaper shipping
- Faster to customers worldwide

The new batch is printing now.

Sometimes getting punched in the face is exactly what you need.
