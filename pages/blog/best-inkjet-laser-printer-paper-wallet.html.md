# Best Printer Paper for Bitcoin Paper Wallets (2025)

**TL;DR:** Neenah linen paper ($0.08/sheet) for bulk printing. Southworth cotton ($0.15/sheet) for premium gifts. Both work with inkjet AND laser.

Your paper wallet's credibility starts with how it feels. Get it wrong = Monopoly money.

|------------|---------------|--------------|

| **Linen** | Good absorption | Perfect texture match |
| **Smooth** | Vibrant but can smudge | Clean, professional |
| **Thick (110lb+)** | Excellent | May need manual feed |

## Paper Weight Guide

- **20lb (75gsm)**: Too thin, feels cheap
- **24lb (90gsm)**: Minimum acceptable
- **32lb (120gsm)**: Sweet spot ← RECOMMENDED
- **65lb (175gsm)**: Cardstock territory
- **110lb (300gsm)**: Manual feed only

## Paper Cost Analysis (100 Wallets)

| Paper Choice | Cost per Sheet | 100 Sheets | Quality |
|--------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| **HP Premium 32lb** | $0.04 | $4 | Good |
| **Neenah Linen** | $0.08 | $8 | Better |
| **Southworth Cotton** | $0.15 | $15 | Best |
| **Crane's Lettra** | $0.25 | $25 | Premium |

Spending extra $0.07 per sheet transforms "printed paper" into "valuable document."

## Printer Settings for Best Results

### For Cotton/Linen with Inkjet:
- Paper type: "Matte Photo Paper"
- Quality: "Best" (never "Fast")
- Dry time: Wait 60 seconds

### For Cotton/Linen with Laser:
- Paper type: "Heavy" or "Thick"
- Manual feed for 32lb+
- Let printer warm up first

## Pro Tips

1. **Test first**: Print on plain paper, then one good sheet
2. **Humidity kills**: Store paper flat, below 50% humidity
3. **Color match**: Ivory paper = warmer feel than white
4. **Manual feed**: Use for paper over 32lb
5. **Dry time**: Inkjet needs 60 seconds before handling

## What to Avoid

- ❌ **All-in-one printers under $100** - Poor color accuracy
- ❌ **Glossy photo paper** - Looks fake, won't fold
- ❌ **Regular 20lb copy paper** - Instant "fake money" feel
- ❌ **Third-party ink/toner** - Inconsistent colors

## Quick Decision Guide

```
What's your priority?
├─ Premium feel → Southworth Cotton 32lb
├─ Best value → Neenah Linen 24lb
├─ Ultra thick → Crane's Lettra 110lb
└─ Tight budget → HP Premium 32lb
```

## The Bottom Line

Don't use regular copy paper. The difference between $0.01 copy paper and $0.08 linen paper is the difference between "I printed this 5 minutes ago" and "this has real value."

**For most people**: **Neenah Classic Linen** ($0.08/sheet) hits the sweet spot - works with both printer types, feels professional, won't break the bank.
