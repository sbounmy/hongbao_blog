# 7 Bitcoin Christmas Gifts Under $25

*Last Updated: November 7, 2025*

Every Christmas, same story.

> "So... how's Bitcoin doing?"

> "Didn't it crash again?"

> "Is it too late to buy?"

I used to launch into passionate explanations about monetary policy and decentralization but it didn't work.

After 8 years of failed orange-pill attempts, I finally figured it out:

**Stop lecturing. Start gifting.**

Here's my 2025 list of Bitcoin gifts under $25 that actually spark curiosity instead of killing conversations. These work because they combine something tangible (a gift they can hold) with education that doesn't feel like homework.

### Easy to read Bitcoin Books for Beginners

### Some bitcoin are the best gift

The best combo is book + some bitcoin

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At friends birthday: 🎁<br><br>BEFORE<br>&quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t have any Bitcoin. I don&#39;t think I will buy it&#39;s too late.&quot;<br><br>AFTER<br>&quot;Ok now I have Bitcoin I will quit my job after I read this book 😂&quot;<br><br>My orange pill recipe :<br>- Print $21 in BTC<br>- A book that is easy to read 21 Leçons or Alice au… <a href="https://t.co/PZHizfRjnz">pic.twitter.com/PZHizfRjnz</a></p>&mdash; Stephane ₿ounmy (@sbounmy) <a href="https://twitter.com/sbounmy/status/1943578237214327268?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Ways to Gift Bitcoin (Under $25)

Now they understand Bitcoin conceptually. Time to give them some:

### **SATSCARD by Coinkite** ($20)
<%= cdn_image_tag("blog/bitcoin-gift-christmas-2025-under-25-usd/satscard.jpg", alt: "SATSCARD", class: "w-full max-w-lg mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-4") %>

**What it is:** Credit card-sized NFC Bitcoin wallet

**How it works:** Tap phone to card, Bitcoin appears

**The good:** Professional, reusable (up to 10 times), fits in wallet

**The bad:** Needs NFC phone, no instructions included

**Best for:** Tech-comfortable recipients who already understand Bitcoin basics

**→** [Get it at Coinkite Store](https://store.coinkite.com/store/category/satscard)

---

### **DIY Paper Wallets** (Free-$5)

**What you need:**
* BitAddress.org (download offline)
* Printer (not networked)
* Nice paper ($5)
* Security envelope ($1)

**Process:**
1. Generate offline for security
2. Print private/public keys
3. Fund with $10-20 Bitcoin
4. Seal in tamper-evident envelope

**Warning:** Easy to mess up security. No built-in help for recipients

---

### **Physical Bitcoin Coins** ($25)

**Brands:** Denarium, Cryptmint
**Reality:** One-time use novelty items
**How they work:** Peel hologram, reveal private key
**Problem:** Confusing redemption process

Look cool, work poorly. Better as conversation pieces.
**→** [Check Denarium](https://denarium.com)

---

### **OpenDime USB Sticks** ($15)
<%= cdn_image_tag("blog/bitcoin-gift-christmas-2025-under-25-usd/opendime.jpg", alt: "OpenDime", class: "w-full max-w-lg mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-4") %>

**Unique feature:** Bearer instrument like cash
**How it works:** Plug in, generates wallet, break to reveal key
**Downside:** Requires computer, intimidating for newcomers
**→** [Get OpenDime](https://opendime.com)

---

### **Bitcoin Gift Cards** ($10-25)

**Where:** Coinbase, Bitrefill, CoinCards
**The catch:** Not real Bitcoin until redeemed
**Issues:** KYC requirements, expiration dates
**Worst part:** Reinforces "Bitcoin = company" misconception
**Verdict:** Avoid unless absolutely desperate

---

So unless you go DIY, the budget to gift Bitcoin + book is going to be more than $25.

## The Best of Both Worlds: [HongBao Bitcoin](https://hongbaob.tc)

I took our traditional chinese red envelope and turn it into Bitcoin gifting.

<%= cdn_image_tag("blog/bitcoin-gift-christmas-2025-under-25-usd/angpao-bitcoin-gift.jpg", alt: "angpao hongbao bitcoin gift", class: "w-full max-w-lg mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-4") %>

### What Makes HongBao Different

* **Bitcoin Red envelope** that will hold your paper wallet like gift wrap.
* **Bitcoiner quote** on the back envelope (Satoshi, Hal Finney, etc.)
* **QR code** links to a getting started (verify balance / redeem funds)
* **Paper wallet** customized with your loved one face to print at home
* **Instructions inside** walk them through everything

**The magic moment:** When they see there face on the bill + bitcoin face

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">His reaction when he sees his face &amp; his brother 🤣<br><br>Happy ₿day son ! <a href="https://t.co/gdFs4w6W2c">pic.twitter.com/gdFs4w6W2c</a></p>&mdash; Stephane ₿ounmy (@sbounmy) <a href="https://twitter.com/sbounmy/status/1989635379063034122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### How much it cost

Starting at $2 / gift with [maximalist pricing](https://hongbaob.tc/pricing)

### Why This Works

* **Physical Bitcoin** : kids and normies can touch, no more `"Bitcoin doesn't exist"`

* **Personalized gift** : The wow effect of seeing his face stylized with AI on a piece of paper

* **Instructions** : To be included in the envelope so user have some instructions on how to get started.
