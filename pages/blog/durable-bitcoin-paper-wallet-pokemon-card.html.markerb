# How to Make Your Bitcoin Paper Wallet Last Forever

I gave my son Eren a Bitcoin paper wallet for his birthday.

Two hours later, I found it bent in half on the floor.

The QR code was still readable (barely), but the public address and some mnemonic words were missing.

**Paper wallets are fragile.**

After that, I started thinking: how do Pokemon card collectors protect cards worth thousands of dollars?

Turns out, they've solved this problem decades ago.

## The Pokemon Card Collector Trick

You only need 3 things:

- **Thick paper** (at least 200gsm cardstock)
- **Dragon Shield inner sleeve** (clear, sealable, no glue)
- **Paper trimmer** (for clean edges)

Total cost: under $15. Your paper wallet becomes durable for years.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Print on thick cardstock

Use at least 200gsm paper. Regular printer paper (80gsm) bends too easily.

Set your printer to "high quality" mode. The QR codes and keys need to be crisp and scannable.

### Step 2: Cut with a paper trimmer

Scissors leave uneven edges. A paper trimmer gives you clean, professional borders.

Cut to standard trading card size: 63mm x 88mm (2.5" x 3.5").

### Step 3: Sleeve it like a Pokemon card

Dragon Shield inner sleeves are perfect:
- **Clear** - you can see both sides
- **Sealable** - no glue, just fold the flap
- **Snug fit** - no sliding around

Slide your paper wallet in, fold the top flap down. Done.

Your Bitcoin is now protected from:
- Bending and creasing
- Water splashes
- Dirt and fingerprints

## Bonus: Hide the Private Key

Want extra privacy? Use a Dragon Shield outer sleeve with a matte back.

The front stays clear (public address visible), but the back is opaque. Nobody can see your private key without removing it from the sleeve.

Perfect for storing in a binder or showing off without exposing sensitive info.
