My 8-year-old cousin asked "What's Bitcoin?" I handed her a paper wallet worth $5. She gets it now.

## En bref

- **Schools don't teach sound money** - Kids learn about banks and debt, not saving and value
- **Paper wallets make Bitcoin tangible** - Something they can hold, not just numbers on a screen
- **Start small** - $5-10 is enough to spark curiosity and teach ownership
- **The HODL lesson sticks** - Watching their Bitcoin grow teaches patience better than any lecture

## Why kids should learn about Bitcoin

Schools teach kids about money. Sort of.

They learn that banks hold your money. That credit cards let you buy stuff now and pay later. That saving is good (but here's a 0.01% interest rate that doesn't keep up with inflation).

What they don't learn:

- **Why money loses value over time** (inflation)
- **What "sound money" actually means** (scarcity)
- **How to truly own something** (self-custody)

Bitcoin fixes this. But you can't just explain it. Kids learn by doing.

When a kid holds a paper wallet with their own Bitcoin on it, something clicks. It's theirs. Not the bank's. Not their parents'. *Theirs*.

Here's how Paul Graham explained it to his kids:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How I explained Bitcoin to my kids. A currency needs two things: to be easily transportable, and to be rare. Bitcoin is easily transportable because you can send it from computer to computer, and rare because to make more you have to solve increasingly hard math problems.</p>&mdash; Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1384040569710682113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2021</a></blockquote>

Simple. No blockchain lectures. Just: transportable + rare.

## The problem with teaching savings today

Here's what we tell kids: "Save your money in a piggy bank. Then put it in a savings account. Watch it grow."

Here's what actually happens:

| Year | $100 saved | Real value (after 3% inflation) |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| 0    | $100       | $100                            |
| 5    | $100       | $86                             |
| 10   | $100       | $74                             |
| 18   | $100       | $59                             |

By the time they're adults, their "savings" buy almost half of what they could have bought originally.

**We're teaching kids to save in a currency designed to lose value.**

No wonder Gen Z figured out the game is rigged. Many are already turning to crypto as an alternative.

Bitcoin flips the script. Limited supply. No one can print more. Over time, it tends to go up - not because of speculation, but because of math.

## Paper wallets: making Bitcoin real for kids

Here's the problem with digital Bitcoin: kids can't touch it. It's just numbers on a screen. No different from a video game score.

A paper wallet changes everything.

**What a paper wallet gives kids:**

- Something physical to hold
- A QR code they can scan (tech they already understand)
- The feeling of true ownership
- A "treasure" to keep safe

My cousin keeps hers in a special box. She checks the price on my phone every time I visit. She's 8, and she understands scarcity better than most adults.

Michael Saylor puts it perfectly:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you want to do something satisfying in life, figure out how to give <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> to children &amp; teach them to take personal custody of it. That will do more to change their lives and the world than anything else you could do.</p>&mdash; Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1786829271081582724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2024</a></blockquote>

Parents worldwide are waking up. They're giving their children an asset that appreciates instead of one that sits in a drawer.

**How to present it:**

1. Create a paper wallet with a small amount (we'll talk amounts next)
2. Explain: "This paper has a secret code. That code controls your Bitcoin."
3. Show them how to check the balance with a QR scanner
4. Tell them: "If you lose this paper, you lose your Bitcoin. That's why we keep it safe."

That last part is crucial. It teaches responsibility. Real stakes. No "Mom, can you get it back?" bailouts.

## How much to give by age

Don't overthink this. The goal isn't to make them rich. It's to teach them.

| Age   | Suggested Amount | Why                                                                                |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5-7   | $5               | Concept introduction. "This is worth 5 dollars, but it might be worth more later!" |
| 8-10  | $10              | They can do basic math. Show them price changes.                                   |
| 11-13 | $20-50           | Old enough to understand percentages and growth                                    |
| 14+   | $50-100          | Can grasp investment concepts. Maybe set up their own wallet.                      |

**Pro tip:** Match their age in dollars. 8-year-old? $8 in Bitcoin. Easy to remember, and they love the personal touch.

The amount doesn't matter as much as the lesson. $5 that doubles teaches the same thing as $500 that doubles.

## The HODL lesson

Here's where it gets fun.

After you give them the paper wallet, they'll ask: "Can I spend it?"

**Your answer: "You could. But watch what happens if you don't."**

Set up a simple tracking ritual:
- Check the price together once a month
- Write it down in a notebook
- Calculate how much their Bitcoin is worth now

Some months it goes down. "That's okay. Look at the whole year."

Some months it goes up. "See? Patience."

This teaches delayed gratification better than any allowance system. They're not saving because you told them to. They're saving because they can *see* it working.

> My cousin's $5 is now worth $7. She tells everyone. She also refuses to spend it. The lesson landed.

## Conclusion

Schools won't teach your kids about sound money. Banks won't either. It's on us.

A paper wallet with a few dollars of Bitcoin isn't just a gift. It's a lesson in:
- True ownership
- Scarcity
- Patience
- Responsibility

You don't need to explain the blockchain. You don't need to debate monetary policy. You just need to hand them something that's *theirs* and let them watch what happens.

**Key takeaway:** Stop explaining Bitcoin. Start gifting it.
