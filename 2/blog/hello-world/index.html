<p>This was one of the most constructive feedback we ever received. We know since we started that there was a hongbao bitcoin address scam back in 2018.</p>

<p><img src="blog/hello-world/bitcoin-paper-wallet.png" alt="bitcoin-paper-wallet-scam" />
<a href="[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BitcoinPaperWallet">Bitcoin Paper Wallet Scam</a></p>

<p>So We took the time to decide how/where to write.
After setting Ghost (which is very nice) + Cloudflare worker to have /blog, I felt like it was not that great and I would spend time to setup email provider etc.</p>

<p>Until I asked Alexis from <a href="https://www.rorvswild.com/blog">Rorvswild</a> how did they build their blog in their rails app : <a href="sitepress.cc">Sitepress</a>.</p>

<p>I finally took a few days to setup it up :</p>

<ul>
<li>as a standlone for our SEO writer to be able to use without having to install our main app</li>
<li>as a git submodule so it doesnt lock our deploys and pollute our commits history</li>
<li>as an embed so /blog directly points to the content (SEO ++)</li>
</ul>


<p>The big plus is that we love markdown</p>

<p>Now time to write about our journey and make our place on the bitcoin gifting scene.</p>
