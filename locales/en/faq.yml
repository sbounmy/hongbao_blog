      - q: "Why Paper wallet in 2025 ?"
        a: "It's the perfect medium to gift Bitcoin because they are cheap to produce at home and easy to use. They are not recommended for long term storage as they can be lost, stolen or damaged. For the long term storage, we recommend to use a hardware wallet."

        <li>1. Generate the keys or import your own</li>
        <li>2. Print the paper wallet</li>

      - q: "Can I buy the credits separately from the envelopes?"

      - q: "What happens my recipient loses the paper wallet ?"

      - q: "Can I use the passphrase to access my funds?"
        a: "At the moment, we don't support it because it means that you have to tell your recipient the passphrase (which is not a good idea). If you think this is important contact us."
