    questions:
      - q: "Why Paper wallet in 2025 ?"
        a: "It's the perfect medium to gift Bitcoin because they are cheap to produce at home and easy to use. They are not recommended for long term storage as they can be lost, stolen or damaged. For the long term storage, we recommend to use a hardware wallet."
      - q: "How should I use your paper wallet?"
        a: "You can decide to use an existing Paper Wallet or Generate your own with an image upload.
        <ol>
        <li>1. Generate the keys or import your own</li>
        <li>2. Print the paper wallet</li>
        <li>3. Top them up the amount you want via a credit card, wire transfer or directly from your wallet.</li>
        <li>4. Slip the paper wallet into the envelope.</li>
        <li>5. Gift it to your recipient.</li>
        </ol>"
      - q: "How should my recipient use the paper wallet?"
        a: "If they already have an hardware wallet, they can use hongbao to transfer the Bitcoin to their wallet. If they don't have an hardware wallet, they can use hongbao or any software wallet (Bitcoin Core, Electrum, etc.) to receive the Bitcoin.</br>If they are newcoiners, they can keep it in a drawer until they have setup an hardware wallet."
      - q: "Can I buy the credits separately from the envelopes?"
        a: "At the moment, the credits are only available for free with the envelopes because we believe that the paper wallets alone doesn't give the best gift experience."
      - q: "What are the credits used for ?"
        a: "Credits are used to generate the paper wallet. Each paper wallet costs 1 credit and they are not refundable (yet). You can see how many credits you have left hovering on your profile picture called ₿ao."
      - q: "What happens my recipient loses the paper wallet ?"
        a: "We can't do anything, even HongBao as we don't have your keys. Think of it as a gift to the community: lost coins make everyone else‘s worth slightly more."
      - q: "Can someone access my funds by scanning the QR code (private key) ?"
        a: "Yes, the backface contains the private key e.g password. So anyone can read or save it will have access to coins. This is why we put it into a red envelope :)"
      - q: "Can I use the passphrase to access my funds?"
        a: "At the moment, we don't support it because it means that you have to tell your recipient the passphrase (which is not a good idea). If you think this is important contact us."
      - q: "Can I use my own Paper Wallet ?"
        a: "Yes. Our paper wallet generator is to make it easy. If you're a maxi and like your design, you can use ours offline and import your keys."

It has no KYC if you pay by wire transfer, otherwise they have a KYC to prevent card fraud."

        a: "Yes, you can send the envelope by mail but it's not recommended as it's not secure and can be lost or stolen. Red envelopes are well known in asia, so at least you should put the paper walletin a regular envelope."
      - q: "How are the keys generated ?"
        a: "We generate a 256-bit mnemonic seed phrase using <a class='link' href='https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39' target='_blank'>bip39</a> from <a class='link' href='https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib' target='_blank'>bitcoinjs-lib</a> (compiled with Browserify) and <a class='link' href='https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/secp256k1' target='_blank'>@bitcoinerlab/secp256k1</a> for elliptic curve cryptography to derive HD wallets and sign transactions. All cryptographic operations happen securely in your browser - we never see your private keys. If you want to be extra-safe, try to <code>Save page As</code> to be fully offline."
